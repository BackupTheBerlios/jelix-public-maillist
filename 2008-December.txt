Message-ID: <ea2a56170812240407y487f465dl9f75d3e8d5c2516a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, i'm Mario and i'm new to webdevelopment. I've tried many
frameworks, and Jelix looks very good for me. It's somewhat different
from others. I'm learning from tutorial and manual, they are very good
too.

I need to develop an application wich will be in a server, and will be
used by many companies, hopeful ;>)

My thought is to develop a base application with the common
functionality, and derive instances for each company. Only where a
company has different needs, i overwrite specific methods.

Can this schema be implemented with Jelix ? How ?

Thanks and Merry Christmas !!!

Hello !

Yes of course, you can do this schema.


- You can develop some modules shared by many applications.
- if you want to have differents templates, you can create a theme for 
each company
- you can redefine forms, daos, properties files (localization) for a 
specific company without modifying the original files
- and of course, you can add specific modules for the needs of a 
specific companies.

And there are plugins on many things (template, authentification, acl, 
coordinator etc..) so you can have different configuration, behavior etc..

So, jelix is highly extensible.

Note that the tutorials and the manual for Jelix 1.1 are not fully 
complete, and Jelix 1.1 will be release during first weeks of 2009.

Don't hesitate to post questions on the forums or in this mailing-list.

Merry Christmas !
